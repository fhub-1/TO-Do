What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a programming language that developers use to make interactive webpages. It is a core technology of the World Wide Web, enabling dynamic web applications, and can be used for both client-side and server-side development.
How does JavaScript work?

JavaScript code is interpreted by a JavaScript engine, with modern engines using just-in-time or runtime compilation. In client-side JavaScript, the engine inside the browser executes code based on events and manipulates the Document Object Model (DOM). Server-side JavaScript runs on the server, providing customization and database access.
What are JavaScript libraries?

JavaScript libraries are collections of prewritten code snippets for standard JavaScript functions. They are used to enhance web development in areas such as data visualization, DOM manipulation, forms, and math and text functions.
What are JavaScript frameworks?

JavaScript frameworks are complete tool sets for web development. They help structure and organize web applications and are used for various purposes, including web and mobile app development, responsive web design, and server-side application development.
What are HTML and CSS?

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are two other languages used in frontend development. HTML structures web content, while CSS is used to apply styling to HTML elements.
HTML vs. CSS vs. JavaScript

These three languages work together to create a positive user experience on websites. While HTML and CSS mainly handle static content, JavaScript can dynamically update content by integrating with HTML and CSS.
What are the benefits of JavaScript?

    Ease of Learning: JavaScript has a syntax inspired by Java and is easy to learn and code, making it widely used in web and mobile app development.

    Platform Independence: JavaScript can be inserted into any webpage and used with various web development frameworks and languages, providing platform independence.

    Reduced Server Load: JavaScript can perform logical operations on the client side, reducing server load and network congestion.

    Improved User Interface: JavaScript enhances website functionality, readability, and user interaction, leading to more efficient user interfaces.

    Concurrency Support: JavaScript can run multiple sets of instructions in parallel, and Node.js on the backend can handle highly scaled server responses efficiently.

What are the limitations of JavaScript?

    Weakly Typed Language: JavaScript is weakly typed, allowing variables to store any data type at runtime. This can lead to type errors and coding mistakes.
