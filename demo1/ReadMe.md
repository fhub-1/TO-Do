 I'll explain each function in the provided JavaScript code in Markdown format:
addTask()

This function is responsible for adding a new task to the task list when the user clicks the "Add" button or presses the Enter key in the task input field.

    It first checks if the input field is empty or only contains whitespace. If it is, it returns early and does not add an empty task.
    It creates a new list item (<li>) for the task with a delete button.
    The task text is added to the list item along with an associated delete button.
    The new list item is appended to the task list (taskList).
    The task text is saved to local storage using the saveTask() function.
    The input field is cleared.
    An event listener is attached to the delete button, allowing users to remove the task.

saveTask(taskText)

This function saves a task to local storage. It receives the task text as a parameter.

    It retrieves the current list of tasks from local storage using the getTasksFromStorage() function.
    The new task text is added to the array of tasks.
    The updated tasks array is stored in local storage after converting it to a JSON string.

removeTask(taskText)

This function removes a task from local storage. It receives the task text as a parameter.

    It retrieves the current list of tasks from local storage using the getTasksFromStorage() function.
    It filters the tasks array to exclude the task that matches the provided task text.
    The filtered tasks array is stored back in local storage after converting it to a JSON string.

getTasksFromStorage()

This function retrieves the list of tasks from local storage.

    It fetches the tasks data from local storage using the key "tasks."
    If there is no data in local storage, it returns an empty array as a default value.
    It parses the stored JSON string into an array of tasks and returns it.

loadTasks()

This function loads tasks from local storage and populates the task list when the page loads.

    It retrieves the list of tasks from local storage using the getTasksFromStorage() function.
    It iterates over the tasks array and creates a list item for each task with a delete button.
    The list item is added to the task list.
    Event listeners are attached to the delete buttons to allow users to remove tasks.

helloWorld()

This function displays an "Hello World!" alert when called.
cookies()

This function displays a "This website uses cookies" alert to the user if they haven't accepted it during their session. It utilizes sessionStorage to remember whether the user has seen the message in the current session. If they have, it won't display the alert again.

Please note that these explanations provide an overview of each function's purpose and functionality. The code itself contains comments that further clarify how each part of the code works.
